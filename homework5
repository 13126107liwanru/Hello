My understanding of formal methods in general and model checking:
Formal methods = formal specification + formal verification
Formal specification 
As part of defect prevention
Formal => prevent/reduce defect injection due to imprecision, ambiguity, etc
Briefly covered as related to FV
Formal verification 
As part of QA, but focus on positive
"Prove absence of fault"
People intensive
Several commonly used approaches
Chapter 15 focus on basic ideas
Model checking
Behavioral specification via FSMs
Proposition: property of interest expressed as a suitable formula
Model checker: algorithm/program to check proposition validity
Proof: positive result
Counterexample: negative result
