The course is based on classical textbook on SQA, combined with introduction to industry practices and up-to-date tools, sharing latest news and cases.

A real project will be used as example through the course.

Group discussion will be used for theory part while actual testing will be performed for the pratice part. So, hoemwork will be discussion preparation and test run.
